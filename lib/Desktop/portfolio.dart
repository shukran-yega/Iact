The two pilot episodes were screened live using mobile cinema in 10 wards of each of the MPs' constituencies; the screenings were similar to a village meeting. Pre- and post-interviews were conducted with randomly selected respondents. The research team covered about half of the wards in each constituency using a mixed-method exercise, as appropriate to the theme/topic of exploration.",
